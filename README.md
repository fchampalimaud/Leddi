# Leddi - Lighting Control System

### Overview
Leedi is a programmable LED light control system designed to manage lighting schedules using an internal Real-Time Clock (RTC). This system synchronizes the clock via serial communication, enabling automatic time updates to maintain consistent schedules. The schedules are stored in the microcontroller's flash memory, allowing the system to operate autonomously. This makes Leedi particularly useful for applications such as circadian rhythm studies.


## Features


## Requirements
- **Hardware**: Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 microcontroller.
- **Software**: Arduino CLI installed on your computer. [Installation guide for Arduino CLI](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.24/installation/)

### Getting Started
To compile and upload the code for the Lighting Control System to the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 microcontroller on COM5, youâ€™ll need to use the Arduino CLI.



#### 1. Set up the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Board Definition
To ensure that Arduino CLI recognizes the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3, add the ESP32 core to Arduino CLI with these commands:

```bash
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
```

Configure cycles and patterns respectivly. A cycle in one complete repetition of a pattern. 


for in vitro light stimulation, cells were
stimulated at 24 h after transfection with a 30 s ON and 30 s OFF blue
light pulse (470 nm, 0.1â€“4 mW/cm2
; ThorLabs, Newton, NJ, USA) unless
otherwise noted. Light cycles were programmed by connecting to a
DC2100 LED driver with pulse modulation (ThorLabs, Newton, NJ,
USA). The light intensity was measured by using an optical power
meter from ThorLabs (Newton, NJ, USA)


# Installation


# Usage Instructions

1. Plug the **Leedi** device into your computer via **USB**.
2. Open **PowerShell** (or your preferred terminal) and navigate to the directory where the program is installed, activate the environment and run the main script:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/Leedi
   uv init
   uv run .\src\main.py
   ```

3. Once the application window opens, locate the correct **COM port** where the device is connected, and press `Connect`.
    Wait until the status changes from **Not Connected** to **Connected** (ðŸ”´ â†’ ðŸŸ¢). This process can take up to **30 seconds**, during which the interface will be **non-responsive**.

4. Adjust the **main settings** and **lighting patterns**, or load a pre-set configuration from a **JSON file**.
5. (Optional) Click `Generate Plot` to visualize the lighting pattern before applying it.
6. Press `Configure` to upload the settings to the device.
7. Close the application window. Wait **30 seconds** before unplugging the device from your computer.
